        3. Early Testing  - Start as early as Possible
        4. Defect Clustering  - Defect will not Spread in a Group
        5. The Pesticide Paradox  - Regularly Review and Revised
        6. Testing is Context Dependent - Different Sites are Check Differently
        7. Absence of Errors Fallacy - Requirements are not Matched with given Requirement
